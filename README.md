# Testing-Algorithms-May-2021
/*Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

I created this folder to show case some algorithms & some Class/Unit tests in a couple of languages.
INDEX
1. stringMutation.js An algorithm (written in Javascript) to see if one word contains all the chars in another. Brief, notes & forward at the start. Also brief overview version control.
2. Concise String Mutation directory & conciseStrMut.js & conciseStrMutTests.js added.
3. Things to follow...
- Type up 2 Industry E.G's for testing MS Word Doc { Testing Notes }.
- Algo tests Javascript using Mocha framework.
- Algo tests Python unittest framework.
- Algo tests Java Junit framework.
- Algo tests Ruby Minitest framework.

I hope it is informative & relevant for you.
